interactive linear regression in the browser

## Overview

Using `TensorFlow.js` and `p5.js`, I created a simple linear regression model (`y = mx + b`). The project is highly interactive as you can add your own data for training. I'm hoping this will be used for educational purposes.

Note: Most of the code here was based off of The Coding Train's [Coding Challenge #104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLp10CFIvxI).
